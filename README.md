# Detection of Plastic in Marine Bodies

## Overview
Plastic pollution in marine environments is a pressing issue affecting aquatic life and ecosystems. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that detects plastic in water bodies using image processing and deep learning techniques.

## Features
- Uses deep learning to classify images of water bodies and detect plastic waste.
- Employs computer vision techniques for precise identification.
- Provides real-time detection for potential environmental monitoring applications.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Anirudh0314m/Detection-of-Plastic-in-marine-bodies.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Detection-of-Plastic-in-marine-bodies
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- Run the model on sample images to detect plastic pollution.
- Integrate with a drone or underwater camera system for large-scale monitoring.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve model accuracy with a larger dataset.
- Deploy as a web or mobile application for easy access.
